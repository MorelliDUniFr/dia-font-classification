### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify words from 15 (initially) different fonts.

In the following image, we can see the general workflow needed to be done in order to solve the task.

## Initial Idea
Our first idea is to achieve the font classification using a ML model.

### First look at the dataset
The dataset (`fonts/`) is composed of 15 different folders, each one containing 1'000 images.

From an initial look at the different images, we can say that each font contains images of word of different colors, and
the words from a font to another are different in general (there could be some cases that some fonts contain the same word,
but we can't take that as an absolute truth).

### Principal difficulties
The principal difficulties that we can see are:
* Correctly loading the dataset
* Preprocessing the images
* Choosing the right model
* Evaluating the model

### Evaluation metrics
We can use a handful of metrics to evaluate the performance of our model. The ones we are choosing are:
* Accuracy: the ratio of correctly predicted observation to the total observations
* Precision: the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations
* Recall: the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class
* F1-score: the weighted average of Precision and Recall
* Confusion matrix (15x15 matrix): a table used to describe the performance of a classification model
* ROC curve: a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied

### Workload estimation and task assignment
The main tasks that we can see are:
* Data loading and preprocessing
* Model selection and training
* Model evaluation

We can assign the tasks as follows:
* Person 1: Data loading and preprocessing
* Person 2: Model selection and training
* Both: Model evaluation
