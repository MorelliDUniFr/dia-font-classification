### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify words from 15 (initially) different fonts.

In the following image, we can see the general workflow needed to be done in order to solve the task.

## Initial Idea
Our first idea is to achieve the font classification using a ML model.

### First look at the dataset
The dataset (`font/`) is composed of 15 different folders, each one containing 1'000 images.

From an initial look at the different images, we can say that each font contains images of word of different colors, and
the words from a font to another are different in general (there could be some cases that some fonts contain the same word,
but we can't take that as an absolute truth).
